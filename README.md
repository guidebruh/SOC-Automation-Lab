# SOC-Automation-Lab

## Objective
The SOC Automation Lab project establishes a hands-on environment replicating professional Security Operations Center (SOC) processes. Its core purpose is to automate security event monitoring, alerting, and incident response using open-source tools. Participants will ingest telemetry, simulate attacks, and manage cases in a workflow reflecting modern cybersecurity operations.

## Skills Learned
- Practical experience automating SOC event collection and analysis.
- Proficiency configuring and integrating SIEM, SOAR, and case management platforms (Wazuh, Shuffle, TheHive).
- Ability to generate realistic attack telemetry using tools like Sysmon and Mimikatz.
- Understanding of incident detection, alerting workflows, and coordinated response actions.
- Enhanced analytic capabilities and critical thinking in network and endpoint security contexts.

## Tools Used
- Wazuh (SIEM): Centralized event management, alerting, and log ingestion.
- Shuffle (SOAR): Workflow automation, orchestration, and incident response.
- TheHive (Case Management): Case creation, investigation tracking, and analyst collaboration.
- Sysmon: Windows event generation and telemetry for lab exercises.
- Mimikatz: Attack simulation and telemetry creation for detection testing.
- Digital Ocean / VMware: Hosting and infrastructure for lab components.

## Lab Structure
This lab is based on guided exercises from the MyDFIR YouTube series, including:
- Initial infrastructure setup (Windows client, Wazuh, TheHive).
- Sysmon deployment and baseline event generation.
- Attack simulation using tools like Mimikatz to produce detections.
- Alert creation and forwarding in Wazuh.
- Automated workflow building with Shuffle for incident response.
- Case management and escalation via TheHive.
- Extension exercises and recommended self-guided labs for further skills development.
